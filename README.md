# Homework--Two--Portfolio
  The objective of this project was to create a portfolia webpage using a collection of CSS snippets. 
  
## What was done in the Homework--two
 I created a webpage that contained an "about-me", a profile avatar,a section that included all the project I have completed, and a contact me section. 
 Next, I added nav links at the top of the page that jumped to their respective parts of the page. 
 After that I created a hover status for the nav, work, and contact me sections. 
 Finally, I used media queries modify the site based on the type of device its being viewed on.
